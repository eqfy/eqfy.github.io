Hi there üëã

My name is Eric or Qifan Yan (Èó´ÂêØÂ∏Ü). I am a master's student under the supervision of [Dr. Raouf Boutaba](https://rboutaba.cs.uwaterloo.ca/index.html) at the [University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/). I am broadly interested in distributed systems, networking, and machine learning (specifically federated learning). Previously, I completed my undergraduate honors thesis with [Dr. Ivan Beschastnikh](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/) at the [University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/)'s [Systopia Lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/). We explored cool ways of addressing the communication bottleneck in cross-device federated learning with techniques like update compression, client sampling, and scheduling. Furthermore, I have industry experience at Amazon, SAP, and Deloitte, where I worked on software and business development projects. Ultimately, I want to design and build novel systems to make machine learning more accessible to the public.

Outside of computer science, I graduated from UBC's [Master of Management Dual Degree Program](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/programs/dual-degrees/bachelor-and-master-management/overview), where I got to take some eye-opening business courses and interact with many interesting people in other fields. I also love experiencing the outdoors and trying new strategy/simulation/RPG games. A recent hike I enjoyed tremendously is [Stawamus Chief](https://bcparks.ca/stawamus-chief-park/) in Squamish, BC, Canada. A recent game I had a lot of fun with is [Unicorn Overlord](https://unicornoverlord.atlus.com/index.html?lang=en).

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in chatting!
