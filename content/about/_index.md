Hi thereðŸ‘‹

I am a undergraduate student working with [Dr. Ivan Beschastnikh](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/) and [Dr. Mathias LÃ©cuyer](http://mathias.lecuyer.me/) at the [UBC Systopia Lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/). I am broadly interested in topics in *distributed systems*, *mobile computing*, and *machine learning*. Recently, I have been working on federated learning (FL). Specifically, I try to mitigate the communication bottleneck of FL under highly heterogeneous network conditions with masking, sampling, and scheduling. Ultimately, my aim is to make personalized and private machine learning more accessible for the ordinary user by employing the latest systems designs.

Prior to FL, I worked with [Dr. Alexander J. Summers](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~alexsumm/) on the verification of thread-based concurrent programs in Rust with [Prusti](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/prusti.html). In this experience, I discovered that Rust is probably my favourite programming language. I also finished three internships in software development at Amazon, SAP, and Deloitte where I got to work on real-world production systems impacting millions of people.

Outside of computer science, I love experiencing the outdoors, playing the violin, watching anime, and trying out new strategy/simulation games. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in chatting!
